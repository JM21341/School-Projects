# School Projects

## MUST READ

This repository involves the programming progjects I've made during my years in college. It shows the improvement of my skills as I learn different concepts from face-to-face lectures and lecture books. This repository won't involve the major projects I've made but a compilation of minor projects from which I was tasked to do. The scope is limited to book activities, seatworks in school and homeworks.
